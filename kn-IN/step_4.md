## Lists of details

Your story time program will generate a lot of the story at random. That's part of the fun! You need to create some lists to store different and funny words that the final program can choose random items from for the story.

Lists can be named in the same way as variables. For example, to create a list called `numbers` with four items in it, you could use the line `numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three"]`.

\--- task \---

Underneath the last line of code in your program, leave a line blank and then create a list of things that the dragon can interact with. Either use the same list that is shown here, or add different items to the list. <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/234f6ed347" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe> 

\--- /task \---

Now you need some more lists:

- A list for the names of the dragon's `friends`
- A list for `actions` such as "kiss", "throw", and "steal"
- A list for `places` such as "Middle Earth" and "Narnia"

\--- task \---

Make three more lists that have the names `friends`, `actions`, and `places`.

To make the lists, you need to give each list a name.

```python
friends = []
actions = []
places  = []
```

Add strings as list items to all the lists, such as these strings for `friends`.

```python
friends = ["Lila", "Naomi", "Noelle", "Idris", "Jonah", "Ari"]
```

Here is what your completed code should look like: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/5e264dd3e2" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen mark="crwd-mark"></iframe>
