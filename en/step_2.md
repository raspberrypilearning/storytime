## Make your story interactive

--- task ---

Open the starter project.

**Online**: open the Trinket starter project at [rpf.io/storytimeon](https://rpf.io/storytimeon){:target="_blank"}.

**Offline**: download the [starter project](https://rpf.io/p/en/storytime-go){:target="_blank"} and open it in a text editor

If you need to download and install Python, download it from [rpf.io/pythonoff](https://rpf.io/pythonoff){:target="_blank"}.

In the starter project, you should see a single line of code:

```python
from random import choice
```

--- /task ---

The purpose of the story time program is to generate a story, and print the story to the screen so that you can read it. So first, learn how to use the Python `print` function.

--- task ---

In your `storytime.py` file, type the following code on a new line:
	
```python
print("We are going to hear a story about a dragon!")
```

--- task ---

Run the program to see what happens. You should see the words “We are going to hear a story about a dragon!” appear in the output display.

--- /task ---

Now that you can print to the screen, you're ready to ask the user for input, to learn more about the dragon.

--- task ---

Create a new variable called `name`. Use the `input` function to ask the user for the dragon's name. Store the input name in the new `name` variable.

--- task ---

Run your code again to test whether the program asks for input.

--- /task ---

Now that you have the name of the dragon, use the `name` variable to print the name to the screen. In Python, you can use the `+` operator to join strings together.

--- task ---

Add another line of code to print the name of the dragon to the screen. Then run your code.
