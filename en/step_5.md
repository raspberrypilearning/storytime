## Using Random

With lists of actions, places, things, and friends you can write some code that will randomly pick one item from each list. This will help to generate your story, and should make it quirky!

--- task ---
Add in another line of code to create a variable called `friend` and then assign it a random item from the `friends` list.

--- task ---
Now you can use this variable in a `print` function. Each time you run the code the variable will be randomly assigned a new friend.
