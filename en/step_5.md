## Choose your story details

Now that you have lists of actions, places, things, and friends, write some code that randomly picks one item from each list. This will help generate your story, and should make it quirky!

--- task ---
Add in another line of code to create a variable called `friend`. Then assign the new variable a random item from the `friends` list.

--- task ---
Now use the `friend` variable in a `print` function. Each time you run the code, the variable should be randomly assigned a new item from the `friends` list.
