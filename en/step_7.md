## Challenge: more lists

You can make your story even more interesting by adding in some more lists, from which random items can be picked.

Why not create a list of `enemies` or `heroes`? Perhaps you could give the dragon a little more detail by creating a list called `colours` that decides what colour skin it has, or `breath` to see whether it breathes fire, steam or frost.

Your story can be as long as you like, and the only limits are your imagination.
