## Story Time!

Great, you have made it to the fun part. Here is where you get to piece all your hard work together into a story. Here you can be as imaginative and creative as you like bringing it all together.

- This part of the program will be written all on one line. Begin by creating a variable to store your story in by typing `story =`.

2. Then on the same line, open a quotation with `"`.

3. Next, type the start of your story, for example `Once upon a time, there was a`.

4. Leave a space and then close your quotation marks `"`. 

5. Now you can add a random player role by typing `+ player_role +`.

6. Then return to typing your story, by opening quotation marks `" called "`.

7. Add the user's name ` + name +` before writing more of the story.

8. Continue until you have used all your variables like this:

	```python
	story = "Once upon a time, there was a " + actor_role + " called " + name + ". " + pronoun + " and some friends found themselves in the magic land of " + magic_place + ". This land was ruled by " + actor_name + " the " + actor_role + ". All of a sudden a mysterious voice spoke to them from high in the sky and said you must " + quest + " " + actor_name + " the " + actor_role + " to lift the curse of not being able to use technology... "
	```
	
	Remember this should be typed all on one line! Don't forget to use your pronoun variable in your sentence too!
