## Using Trinket

If you do not have a Raspberry Pi then you can write your code and test it in intervals using Trinket in a browser window.  

- Open the blank Python template Trinket: [jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new).
- Follow the instructions in this activity and type your code into the Python template trinket.
- To save your work, click the down arrow and then click ‘Link’. This will give you a link that you can save and come back to later. You’ll need to do this every time you make changes, as the link will change!
