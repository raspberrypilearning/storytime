## Lists

Much of your story that is generated by this program will be random. That's part of the fun. Now you need to create some lists to store different and amusing words that can be used in your final story program. 

Lists can be named in much the same way as variables; for example, `numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three"]`. This list called 'numbers' has **four** items in it.

Underneath the last line of code you have written in your story time program, leave a line blank and then create a list of things for the dragon to interact with. You can use the same code as shown here, or add anything you like to the list.
