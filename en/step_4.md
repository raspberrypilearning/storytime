## Lists

A lot of the story that is generated by this program will be random. That's part of the fun! Now you need to create some lists to store different and funny words that can be used in your final story program. 

Lists can be named in much the same way as variables, for example, `numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three"]`. This list called 'numbers' has **four** items in it. 

--- task ---
Underneath the last line of code you wrote in your story time program, leave a line blank and then create a list of things for the dragon to interact with. You can use the same code as shown here, or add something else to the list.

Now you need some more lists:
- one for the names of the dragon's `friends`
- one for `actions` such as "kiss", "throw", and "steal"
- one for `places` such as "Middle Earth" and "Narnia"

--- task ---
Make three more lists using the names `friends`, `actions` and `places`.

--- hints --- --- hint ---
To make the lists, each list must have a name.
```python
friends = []
actions = []
places  = []
```
--- /hint --- --- hint ---
Add in strings to the lists such as this one for `friends`.

```python
friends = ["Lila", "Naomi", "Noelle", "Idris", "Jonah", "Ari"]
```

Here is what your completed code should look like:
