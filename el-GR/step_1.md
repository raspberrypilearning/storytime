When we want to represent a colour in a computer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that make up that colour. These amounts are usually stored as a single byte and therefore as a number between 0 and 255.

Here's a table showing some colour values:

| Red | Green | Blue | Colour  |
| --- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| 255 | 0     | 0    | Red     |
| 0   | 255   | 0    | Green   |
| 0   | 0     | 255  | Blue    |
| 255 | 255   | 0    | Yellow  |
| 255 | 0     | 255  | Magenta |
| 0   | 255   | 255  | Cyan    |

You can find a nice [colour picker to play with at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp){:target="_blank"}.
