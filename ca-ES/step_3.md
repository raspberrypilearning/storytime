## Using IDLE on Raspberry Pi

A great way to write your code and test it in intervals is to use IDLE, a development application for Python. You will be writing your code in Python 3.

- Load **IDLE3** by clicking on the **Main Menu** followed by **Programming** and then selecting **Python 3**.

2. Once the Python Shell window has loaded, click on **File** and **New Window**. This will open a text editor window in which you can write, save and test your code.

3. Save the blank file as `storytime.py` by clicking on **File** and **Save As**.
